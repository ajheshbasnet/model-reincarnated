#  LSTM-NextWord

A **Next Word Prediction** model built using **PyTorch and LSTM** architecture.  
This project demonstrates sequence modeling for predicting the next word based on a given input sentence or word sequence.

---

##  Project Overview

This project trains a deep learning model to **predict the next word** in a sentence using:
-  **PyTorch** for model building and training  
-  **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** for handling sequential text data  
-  **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab** for development and visualization
